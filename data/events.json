It's not just about the technology, the client applications, or the services implementation - those are all just pieces that fit into a much larger vision: Education needs to be accessible to anyone, everyone, for free, and needs to be as effective as possible. To accomplish this, I mix a variety of disciplines: The design rigor that only comes from being a seasoned software engineer, the business analytics experience from my management background, my strong ethical code from OSS and an academic family, and the creative background from my BArch that allows me to not only design an integrated system, but imagine how it can grow.",
